# 🔐 Week 1 – Microsoft Entra ID User Lifecycle Management

## 🎯 Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates the complete **Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML)** identity lifecycle process using Microsoft Entra ID. The JML framework is a foundational IAM concept used to manage employee identities from initial onboarding through role changes to eventual offboarding.

This lab simulates real-world scenarios that IAM analysts encounter daily in enterprise environments.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- **Joiner Process:** New employee onboarding and initial access provisioning
- **Mover Process:** Internal transfers, role changes, and access recertification
- **Leaver Process:** Secure employee offboarding and access revocation
- **Group-Based Access Control:** Using security groups to manage permissions
- **Audit Trail Management:** Maintaining compliance documentation
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Granting minimum necessary access

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Entra ID** (Azure Active Directory)
- **Security Groups** for role-based access
- **User Profile Management** for identity attributes
- **Azure Portal** for administration
- **PowerShell** (optional) for automation and audit exports

---

## 📋 Lab Scenario

### Context
I simulated a complete employee lifecycle for a fictional employee, **Alex Johnson**, within a test organization. The scenario covers three distinct phases that mirror real-world IAM operations.

### Phase 1: Joiner (New Employee Onboarding)
**Scenario:** Alex Johnson joins the company as an IT Support Specialist on January 19, 2026.

**Actions Performed:**
- Created user account in Entra ID with complete profile information
- Assigned to IT-Department security group
- Assigned to All-Employees security group
- Configured manager relationship (Sarah Manager)
- Set temporary password with forced change on first login
- Documented baseline access grants

**Result:** Functional user account ready for Day 1 productivity

---

### Phase 2: Mover (Internal Role Transfer)
**Scenario:** Alex transfers from IT Support to Finance Department as a Financial Analyst.

**Actions Performed:**
- Updated user profile (job title, department, manager)
- Removed from IT-Department security group
- Added to Finance-Department security group
- Verified access changes reflected correctly
- Documented access impact analysis

**Result:** User access properly aligned with new role, old access revoked

---

### Phase 3: Leaver (Employee Offboarding)
**Scenario:** Alex Johnson departs the company.

**Actions Performed:**
- Exported group memberships for compliance audit
- Disabled user account (not deleted for retention)
- Removed all security group memberships
- Added offboarding notes to user profile
- Reviewed sign-in logs for final activity
- Documented complete offboarding procedure

**Result:** Account secured, access revoked, audit trail maintained

## 🎓 What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- How to create and manage user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID
- Implementing group-based access control for scalable permissions management
- Managing organizational hierarchy through manager assignments
- Proper offboarding procedures to maintain security and compliance
- Exporting identity data for audit and governance purposes

### IAM Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users receive only the minimum access needed for their role
- **Identity Lifecycle Management:** Systematic approach to managing identities from creation to deletion
- **Separation of Duties:** Different roles have distinct access levels
- **Audit Trail Importance:** Every identity change must be documented for compliance
- **Compliance First:** Disable accounts instead of immediate deletion to support retention policies

### Business Impact
- Proper JML processes prevent unauthorized access and security breaches
- Timely offboarding reduces insider threat risk
- Accurate provisioning improves employee productivity on Day 1
- Group-based access simplifies compliance audits
- Documentation supports regulatory requirements (SOX, HIPAA, etc.)

## 🔄 Real-World Applications

This lab simulates authentic enterprise scenarios:

**In Production Environments:**

1. **Joiner Process**
   - HR system triggers automated user creation
   - IT provisions access based on job role templates
   - New employee receives credentials before start date
   - Manager approves access requests via workflow

2. **Mover Process**
   - Manager initiates transfer request in HRIS
   - Automated workflow updates directory attributes
   - Access adjusts based on new role automatically
   - Old and new managers receive notifications

3. **Leaver Process**
   - HR enters termination date in system
   - Automated workflow disables account at specified time
   - All application access revoked simultaneously
   - Audit report generated for compliance team
   - Data retained per legal/compliance requirements

**Automation Opportunities:**
- Integration with HRIS systems (Workday, ADP, BambooHR)
- Automated provisioning to connected applications (M365, ServiceNow, Salesforce)
- Self-service approval workflows via PowerApps or ServiceNow
- Scheduled access reviews and attestation campaigns
- Automated license reclamation from disabled accounts

## 📊 Process Metrics

If this were a production environment, success would be measured by:

| Metric | Manual Process | Target (Automated) | My Lab Result |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Time to provision new user | 30-60 minutes | < 5 minutes | ~5 minutes (manual) |
| Time to transfer user | 20-30 minutes | < 2 minutes | ~3 minutes (manual) |
| Time to offboard user | 20-40 minutes | < 1 minute | ~5 minutes (manual) |
| Access accuracy | 85-90% | > 99% | 100% (verified) |
| Audit compliance | 70-80% | 100% | 100% (documented) |

**Key Takeaway:** While I performed these tasks manually for learning, in production these processes should be heavily automated to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

## 🚀 Next Steps in My IAM Journey

Building on this foundation, upcoming labs will add:

- **Week 2:** Conditional Access policies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Week 3:** Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Just-In-Time admin access
- **Week 4:** Automated access reviews and governance workflows
- **Week 5:** PowerShell automation for bulk JML operations
- **Week 6:** Guest user lifecycle and B2B collaboration
- **Week 7:** SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration
- **Week 8:** OAuth and OpenID Connect implementation

Each lab builds progressively toward comprehensive IAM engineering capabilities.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

Throughout this lab, I applied security best practices:

- ✅ Forced password change on first login (prevents credential exposure)
- ✅ Used temporary credentials (not permanent passwords)
- ✅ Disabled accounts before deletion (maintains audit trail)
- ✅ Removed group access immediately upon departure (prevents unauthorized access)
- ✅ Documented all changes (supports compliance and forensics)
- ✅ Verified access changes (ensures accuracy)
- ✅ Applied least privilege (users had only necessary access)

**In production, additional controls would include:**
- MFA enforcement (covered in Week 2)
- Conditional Access policies (covered in Week 2)
- Privileged access management (covered in Week 3)
- Automated deprovisioning across all connected systems
- Legal hold processes for litigation/investigation
- Data retention policies aligned with compliance requirements
